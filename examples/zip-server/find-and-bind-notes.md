## Find And Bind Notes

These notes outline the planned functionality of the +findAndBind+ method of the +discovery.js+ NodeJS module.

## Description
Find and Bind is a single action that allows services to interact with a DISCO registry all in one step;

Sample call:

 +discovery.findAndBind(serviceIdentity,servicesNeeded,callback)+

where:

 * +serviceIdentity+ is your service's +serviceName+ and +serviceURL+
 * +servicesNeeded+ is a collection of filters (one for each dependent service you wish to use)
 * +callback+ is a function to execute after the +findAndBind+ work is completed
